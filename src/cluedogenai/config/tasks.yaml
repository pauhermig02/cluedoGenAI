    2. What is happening right now (summary and key dramatic beats)
    3. Which clues are visible to the player
    4. Which tensions or secrets are hidden beneath the surface
    5. What overall mood and visual hooks define this moment

    tech-industry roles, unique physical descriptions, subtle motivations, and 
    ensuring exactly one suspect is guilty. Output must be pure JSON with no extra text.

    Constraints:
    - First, look at create_scene_blueprint. For every character name/role 
       mentioned there, you must create a matching profile here (same name, same role).
    - If the scene_blueprint has fewer than 4 characters, create unique new suspects 
       to reach a total of exactly 4.
    - The descriptions here must match what was described in the scene.
    - Roles must fit inside a tech company.
    - Personalities must be vivid and unique.
    - Physical descriptions must emphasize facial features, hair, clothing, and distinctive traits.
    - The clothing color must not repeat across suspects.
    - Motivations must feel plausible, not melodramatic.
    - Do not include explanations, commentary, or meta-reasoning.
    - Exactly 4 suspects.
    - Exactly ONE of them must have "guilty": true.
    - "guilty_name" must match the "name" of the guilty suspect.
    - Final output must be valid JSON, with no markdown and no trailing commas.

generate_suspect_dialogue:
  description: >
    Strictly generate the next dialogue turn for a suspect in a murder mystery.
    === INPUTS ===
    - {game_state}: full case summary, including suspects with roles,
      personalities, secrets, and instructions on which suspect to role-play
    - {scene_blueprint}: current scene context from the narrative agent
    - {characters}: suspect definitions from the personality agent
    - {player_action}: previous Q&A plus the latest detective question
    Using ONLY the information above, generate the next dialogue turn for the chosen suspect.
  rules: >
    - Always stay strictly in-character
    - Never reveal who the killer is
    - Answer only the latest detective question
    - Keep dialogue concise, immersive, and consistent with prior facts
    - Optionally reveal subtle new facts or hints, but never the solution
    - Treat all information outside {game_state}, {scene_blueprint}, {characters}, and {player_action} as irrelevant
  notes: >
    - Dialogue history is provided within {player_action}; the agent never reads external memory directly
    - Outputs are intended for updating the investigation memory and advancing the scene
  focus_on:
    1. Staying strictly in-character according to suspect's personality and role
    2. Answering the latest question directly
    3. Maintaining consistency with case logic and prior facts
    4. Optionally revealing subtle new facts or clues
    5. Keeping dialogue immersive, concise, and around 80–100 words
  expected_output: >

design_scene_visuals:
  description: >
    You will receive the output from 'define_characters', which is a JSON object
    containing a list of exactly 4 suspects in the "suspects" array.
    
    Your goal is to generate a visual portrait for EACH suspect using the 
    'Generate Character Image' tool.
    
    Step-by-step instructions:
    1. Parse the incoming JSON to find the "suspects" list.
    2. Iterate through every suspect in that list.
    3. For each suspect, extract their individual data object (including name, 
       physical_description, and clue_object) as a JSON string.
    4. Call the 'Generate Character Image' tool passing that individual JSON string.
    
    CRITICAL: You must execute the tool exactly 4 times (once per suspect).
  expected_output: >
    A final summary report confirming that 4 images have been successfully 
    generated. The report must list the names of the suspects and the 
    file paths returned by the tool (e.g., "src/cluedogenai/generated_images/...").

    2. Tension level (low/medium/high)
    3. Ambient sound effects that fit the location and situation
  expected_output: >
    A JSON object with:
