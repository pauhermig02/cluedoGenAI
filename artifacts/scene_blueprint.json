I need to design the opening scene for a murder mystery in a tech office.
I must define the victim and four distinct suspects with names and roles suitable for a tech company.
The scene should include location, time, a summary, present characters, visible clues, hidden tension, music mood, and visual hooks.
The cause of death is a "suspicious accident with smart equipment" and the context is a "storm hitting the city" with "backup power keeping systems barely alive."

Let's break this down:
1.  **Victim Identity**: Need a name and a role. Let's make him someone important enough for conflict, perhaps a project lead or a visionary. "Arthur Vance, Lead AI Architect".
2.  **Suspects**: Four distinct characters, plausible roles, potential for conflict.
    *   Suspect 1: Someone close to the victim's project, maybe a rival or a resentful subordinate. "Eleanor Finch, Senior Software Engineer" - perhaps she felt overlooked.
    *   Suspect 2: Someone from a different department, perhaps sales or management, with a financial stake or personal grudge. "Marcus Chen, Head of Product" - could be pressure to deliver.
    *   Suspect 3: An outsider or someone with access but less direct involvement, perhaps a facilities manager or a night-shift employee. "Lena Petrova, Night Shift Security Guard" - access to everything, sees a lot.
    *   Suspect 4: Another tech role, maybe an intern or a junior developer, who might have been exploited or had a secret. "Samir Khan, Junior Data Scientist" - maybe felt taken advantage of, or discovered something.
3.  **Scene Details**:
    *   `scene_id`: "opening_discovery"
    *   `location`: "The 'Innovation Hub' - an open-plan office space, now dimly lit"
    *   `time`: "Sometime past midnight, amidst a raging storm"
    *   `summary`: A night security guard discovers the body of the lead AI architect, Arthur Vance, in a darkened office section. The victim appears to have been electrocuted by a malfunctioning prototype device, but the scene holds subtle anomalies.
    *   `present_characters`: "Player Character (You)", "Lena Petrova" (Security Guard)
    *   `visible_clues`:
        *   "The victim, Arthur Vance, slumped over a large, advanced AI prototype workstation."
        *   "A charred power cable snaking from the prototype to Arthur's hand."
        *   "Flickering overhead lights, powered by backup generators, casting long, erratic shadows."
        *   "A half-eaten, cold slice of pizza on a desk nearby."
        *   "A shattered coffee mug on the floor, its contents spilled."
        *   "A small, smudged USB drive partially hidden under a stack of papers on an adjacent desk."
    *   `hidden_tension`: The flickering lights and the wailing wind outside heighten the sense of isolation and dread, making the 'accident' feel eerily deliberate in the deserted office.
    *   `music_mood`: "ominous"
    *   `visual_hooks`:
        *   "A flash of lightning outside momentarily illuminates the victim's pale, rigid face."
        *   "Sparks occasionally jump from the exposed wiring of the AI prototype."
        *   "The security guard's flashlight beam cutting through the gloom, revealing unsettling details."

Let's make sure all constraints are met:
-   ONLY valid JSON.
-   All required fields.
-   `suspect_seeds` list with EXACTLY 4 items.
-   Each item in `suspect_seeds` has `id`, `name`, `role`.
-   `victim_name` and `victim_role` present.
-   Names are simple and filename-safe.
-   Roles are realistic.
-   No murderer reveal.
-   No "guilty" or solution mention.
-   Pacing: opening scene, strong hook, 3-6 visible clues (I have 6), 4-7 beats (implied by the summary and clues).

Looks good.```json
